# Generative AI on Vertex AI

This folder contains code samples and hands-on labs demonstrating the use of [Generative AI models and tools in Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/overview).


* **[Gemini](gemini/README.md)**: Consists of resources on how to use [Gemini on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/overview) in conjunction with other Vertex AI services for enterprise Generative AI use cases and solutions.
* **[Vertex AI LLM Evaluation Services](vertex_evaluation_services/README.md)**: Demonstrate how to use Vertex AI LLM Evaluation Services in conjunction with other Vertex AI services. Additionally, we have provided notebooks that delve into the theory behind evaluation metrics.
* **[Vertex AI Search](vertex_ai_search/README.md)**: A collection of notebooks, with varying levels of complexity, using Vertex AI Search.  The notebooks are aimed to serve as building blocks which can be combined together to achieve higher levels goals.
