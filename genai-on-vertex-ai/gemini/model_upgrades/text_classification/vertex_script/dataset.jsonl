{"reference": "Books", "product": "Your Quick Tip Guide to a Fierce Body\nThis is a bullet-point version of my latest book, Fierce Abs: Your Jump Start Guide to Sculpt, Tighten, and Tone Your Abs. I created the paperback version so you could take my Fierce Tips to the gym, office, or outside. Some people prefer paperback and I understand that. I wanted to offer my fans a shortened version in which I could include some of my best fitness, nutrition, and motivational stuff. It's also priced very inexpensively so that everyone can get a copy. In this book I break down some of the nutrition ideas that you should focus on if you are seeking a Fierce Body. I also give you some great workout ideas and finally, I discuss the body and how to think about making subtle changes that produce REAL results. I hope you enjoy it and good luck with your fitness and nutrition goals!"}
